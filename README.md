# Food_Delivery_PBI_Dashboard
This project showcases dynamic dashboard report that helps a food delivery service to answer 5 of their crucial business questions.

Dataset: <br />
Table 1 - Historical data of demand for a product-canter combination <br />
Table 2 - Product (Meal) features such as category, sub-category, current price, and discount <br />
Table 3 - Information for fulfilment centres like centre area, city information, etc. <br />

The report answers following business questions for the client:
1)	What is the total number of orders catered by the firm? There should be a date filter in the dashboard.
2)	What is the revenue earned by the firm?
3)	What is the total discounted value? What is the overall discount %?
4)	Is the business following the pareto principle?
5)	What are the top 5 selling categories?
6)	Does the operational area of the store influence number of orders?
7)	Are emails & product features on the homepage an effective mode of promotion?
8)	What will be the next 5 weeks forecasted weekly quantity sold for each centre, city, and meal category?
